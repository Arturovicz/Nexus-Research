The idea of this project is to create a trading bot using only technical analysis, since the qualitative/fundamental approach requires opinions from expert analysts and decision makers.
The bot will be based on kraken trading platform, using exceptionnaly kraken api which means that there will only be cryptocurrency trading.
The goal of the project is to make as many versions of the bot as possible, which will use every known technical analysis technique (moving averages, exp. smoothing, etc.) in order to find the best one for short- and mid-term trading.
The language used for this project will essantially be python and the project will depend on  well developed and known libraries like pandas, krakenex, scikit-learn, etc.
