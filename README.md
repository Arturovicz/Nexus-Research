The idea of this project is to create a trading bot using only technical analysis, since the qualitative/fundamental approach requires opinions from expert analysts and decision makers.
The bot is based on kraken trading platform, using exceptionnaly kraken api which means that there will only be cryptocurrency trading.
The goal of the project is to make as many versions of the bot as possible, which will use every known technical analysis technique (moving averages, exp. smoothing, etc.) in order to find the best one for short- and mid-term trading.
The language used for this project is essantially python and the project will depend on  well developed and known libraries like pandas, krakenex, scikit-learn, etc.
Besides the techniques above, deep learning took a huge part for the perormance of the bot. The program was overhauled with Sequential model with LSTM and Dense layers, defining a precision of 93%. 
Lately, it will be possible to add push notifications via a pre-defined messaging application, to coplete the bot.

The shared codes are small, non finished parts of the bot.
